REV Website

## Getting Started

# Setup

Tools you'll need are PHP, git, and composer.

So first thing you'll want to do is clone the repo. If you've never
used git before, I recommend the GitHub GUI. Or, if you know what you're
doing 

	git clone https://github.com/RPI-REV/website.git
	cd website

# Starting

First, install dependencies

	composer install

then start the server

	composer start

and navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the website!

Feel free to make any changes from there.
