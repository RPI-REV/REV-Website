        Rensselaer Electric Vehicle (REV) is a student organization for the
        design of electric vehicles at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
        The team, formerly known as the RPI Solar Car Racing Team, has competed
        in the Shell Eco-marathon since 2011. We have built three cars since we
        were founded, and in 2014 we hope to compete in a new category,
        Urban Concept.
