          Rensselaer Electric Vehicle (REV) is a student organization for the design of electric vehicles at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
          The team, formerly known as the RPI Solar Car Racing Team, has competed in the Shell Eco-marathon since 2011.
          We have built three cars since we were founded, and in 2014 we hope to compete in a new category, Urban Concept.
